# **Enterprise AI-Agent Boilerplate**

**Status:** Production Ready (Level 5)
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Architect:** Antigravity Agent

## **Overview**
This repository contains the **Golden Standard** for initializing AI-driven software projects. It is not just a template; it is a "Governance Engine" that ensures any AI Agent working on the project adheres to strict Enterprise Standards.

## **Core Capabilities**
1.  **Strict Governance:** Agents cannot write code without checking `agentContext.md` first.
2.  **Enterprise Frameworks:** 10+ Integrated Frameworks (See `AgentSetUpProject/README.md`).
3.  **Self-healing:** Includes "ProDoc" protocols for self-maintaining documentation.
4.  **Operational:** Includes 9 "Agentic Workflows" for Hotfixes, Releases, and Audits.
5.  **Flexible:** Supports everything from Local Standalone Apps to Cloud Microservices.

## **Quick Start**
To apply this governance to a new project:

1.  Copy the `AgentSetUpProject` folder to your new repo.
2.  **Review the Checklist:** Open `startAgentProjectSetUp.md` and check/uncheck optional protocols.
    > **Note on Planning Protocol:** The `PlanningProtocol` is checked by default. However, if you are using an advanced AI IDE (like Antigravity) that has built-in planning capabilities, you should **UNCHECK** this to avoid "Planning over Planning" loops.
3.  Run the Agent Directive: "Initialize Project Context using `AgentSetUpProject/agentContext.md`".
4.  The Agent will scaffold your `.agent/rules/` and file structure automatically.
