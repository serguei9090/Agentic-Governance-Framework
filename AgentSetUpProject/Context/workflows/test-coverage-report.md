# Test Coverage Report

## Overview

Run the repo unit tests and coverage, then capture the results in `reports/code_test_report.md`.

## Workflow

### 1) Confirm execution intent
- If the user explicitly says not to run tests now, do not execute commands; explain the intended steps only.
- Otherwise, proceed with execution.

### 2) Run unit tests
- From repo root, run `npm test`.
- Capture pass/fail summary and any notable warnings.

### 3) Run coverage
- From repo root, run `npm run test:coverage`.
- Capture coverage summaries for each workspace/package and any failures.
- Code Coverage acceptance criteria is > 80%

### 4) Write report
- Write a report to `reports/code_test_report.md` in the repo root.
- Keep the report concise, ASCII-only, and include:
  - Commands run
  - Unit test results by package/workspace
  - Coverage summary by package/workspace
  - Notable warnings or failures

Use this template:

```md
# Code Test Report

Commands run:
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:coverage`

Unit test results:
- <package/workspace>: <summary>

Coverage results:
- <package/workspace>: <statements/branches/functions/lines>

Notes:
- <warnings/failures or "None">
```
