# Agent Context Standard

**Status:** Active Development
**Maintainer:** Antigravity Agent

## Overview

The **Agent Context Standard** repository serves as the central hub for defining and maintaining standardized contexts for AI Agents across different technology stacks. It acts as a "Governance Engine" to ensure consistent behavior, structure, and operational standards for agents working in various environments.

This project ensures that any agent (human or AI) entering a new codebase has immediate access to the "Laws of the Physics" for that specific technology stack—knowing exactly how to build, test, secure, and deploy without needing to ask for permission.

## Repository Structure

### 1. [React Context Standard](React-Context-Standart/)
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready (Level 5)

The "Golden Standard" for React-based projects. It includes:
- **Governance:** Strict adherence to `agentContext.md`.
- **Frameworks:** Integrated standards for UI (Atomic Design), State Management, and Error Handling.
- **Workflows:** Pre-defined agentic workflows for Releases, Hotfixes, and Security Audits.
- **Self-Healing:** "ProDoc" protocols that keep documentation up-to-date automatically.

### 2. [Python Context Standard](Python-Context-Standart/)
**Status:** 🚧 Under Construction

Placeholder for the corresponding standard for Python environments (Django/FastAPI/Scripting). Future development will mirror the governance level of the React standard.

## Core Concepts

### Why "Agent Context"?
An "Agent Context" provides the necessary rules, frameworks, and instructions for an AI agent to operate autonomously and safely within a codebase. It defines:
- **Rules:** What is allowed/disallowed (e.g., *“No direct commits to main”*, *“All UI components must be accessible”*).
- **Frameworks:** How to implement specific features (e.g., *“Use Atomic Design for UI components”*).
- **Workflows:** Steps to perform complex tasks reliably (e.g., *“Release Protocol”*, *“Dependency Update”*).

## Usage

To apply these standards to a specific project:

1.  **Select the Stack:** Navigate to the relevant directory (e.g., `React-Context-Standart`).
2.  **adopt the Standard:** Follow the "Quick Start" guide in that directory's README.
    *   *Typically involves copying the `AgentSetUpProject` folder to your target repository.*
3.  **Initialize:** Run the agent initialization prompt to scaffold the standard into your new project's `.agent` directory.
