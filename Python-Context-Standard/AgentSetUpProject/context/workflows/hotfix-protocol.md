# Hotfix Protocol (Emergency)

## Overview
**BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.** 
This workflow bypasses standard feature development cycles to ship a critical fix to Production immediately.

## Workflow

### 1) Preparation
- Checkout Main: `git checkout main`
- Pull: `git pull origin main`
- Branch: `git checkout -b hotfix/<issue-id-description>`

### 2) The Fix
- Implement the minimal necessary change.
- **Scope:** Do NOT include refactors or other features.

### 3) Verification
- Run `pytest` (Focus on affected component).
- Run `rx build` (Ensure it compiles).

### 4) Deployment
- Bump Version: `poetry version patch`
- Commit: `fix(hotfix): <description>`
- Push: `git push origin hotfix/...`
- **Merge Strategy:**
    1.  Merge to `main` (Triggers Prod Deploy).
    2.  Merge to `develop` (Syncs fix for next release).
